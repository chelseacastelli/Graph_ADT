# Homework 1: Graph ADT & Traversals

Follow the instructions [here](https://make-school-courses.github.io/CS-2.2-Graphs-Recursion/#/Assignments/01-Graph-ADT) to complete this assignment.

## Discussion Questions

1. How is Breadth-first Search different in graphs than in trees? Describe the differences in your own words.
    - Once a node is visited in a tree, it is not revisited. This is why we need to keep track of which nodes have been visited in a graphâ€” to avoid going in circles.

2. What is one application of Breadth-first Search (besides social networks)? Describe how BFS is used for that application. If you need some ideas, check out [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-breadth-first-traversal/?ref=rp).
    - Since BFS is used to find the shortest path, this concept is used in GPS systems.

3. Compare and contrast Breadth-first Search and Depth-first Search by providing one similarity and one difference.

4. Explain why a Depth-first Search traversal does not necessarily find the shortest path between two vertices. What is one such example of a graph where a DFS search would not find the shortest path?
    - asda

5. Explain why we cannot perform a topological sort on a graph containing a cycle.
